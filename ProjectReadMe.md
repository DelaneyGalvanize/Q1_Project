# Q1 Project Proposal


## Project Description
I want to create an app (or what will become an app with further progress in my learning career) that will appear as a news page or page for recipes or something like that, but there is a disguised button or link that takes the user to a page that gives them options to call police, call close contacts, send emails or texts to close contacts when they need to get help because they are victim of domestic violence. I am also thinking it might also contain links where they can go visit to get help or advocates they can email if they need help or are making a plan for escape. I got this inspiration from the volunteer work I do!

## What problem does your project solve?
It helps victims of domestic violence who are afraid or are unable to get the help they need.

## How will your project solve this problem?
The hidden button or link(s) will allow them to reach out to contacts and/or the police if they need help. Jealous husbands/boyfriends/wives/girlfriends are very controlling and look at phones, computers and the history of them. This app will be disguised.

## What inputs does it need?
a form will be filled out of their name and what city, state their in. this will be filled out when app is downloaded.

## What outputs does it produce?
news links, emergency link, info links

## What web API(s) will it use?
emergency number api, news apis, google maps for the location, google maps also for location of shelters, police station, etc. potential use of Api that has facts about victims of violence

## What technologies do you plan to use?
