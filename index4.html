            <p> The following steps can help plan for and increase your safety and prepare for the possibility of potential violence. Although you do not have control over your partner's violence, you do have a choice about how to respond to him/her and how
                to best get yourself and your children to safety.

                    <p> Step 1: SAFETY DURING A VIOLENT INCIDENT. Women cannot always avoid violent incidents. In order to increase safety, battered women may use a variety of strategies.</p>
                    <p>I can use some or all of the following strategies:
                        <ul>
                            <li> If I decide to leave, I will <input class='plans'> . (Practice how to get out safely. What doors, windows, elevators, stairwells or fire escapes would you use?) </li>
                            <li> I can keep my purse and car keys ready and put them <input class='plans'> (place) in order to leave quickly. </li>
                            <li> I can tell <input class='plans'> about the violence and request they call the police if they hear suspicious noises coming from my house. </li>
                            <li> I can teach my children how to use the telephone to contact the police and the fire department.</li>
                            <li> I will use <input class='plans'> as my code for my children or my friends so they can call for help.</li>
                            <li> If I have to leave my home, I will go <input class='plans'> (Decide this even if you don't think there will be a next time). If I cannot go to the location above, then I can go to <input class='plans'> or <input class='plans'>                                . </li>
                            <li> I can also teach some of these strategies to some/all of my children.</li>
                            <li> When I expect we are going to have an argument, I will try to move to a space that is lowest risk, such as <input class='plans'> . (Try to avoid arguments in the bathroom, garage, kitchen, near weapons or in rooms without access
                                to an outside door).</li>
                            <li> I will use my judgment and intuition. If the situation is very serious, I can give my partner what he/she wants to calm him/her down. I have to protect myself until I/we are out of danger. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br><br>
                        <div class='step' <p>Step 2: SAFETY WHEN PREPARING TO LEAVE. Battered women frequently leave the residence they share with the battering partner. Leaving must be done with a careful plan in order to increase safety. Batterers often strike back when
                            they believe that a battered woman is leaving the relationship. </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>I can use some or all the following safety strategies:
                        <ul>
                            <li> I will leave money and an extra set of keys with <input class='plans'> so that I can leave quickly. </li>

                            <li>I will keep copies of important papers and documents or an extra set of keys at <input class='plans'> . </li>

                            <li> I will open a savings account by <input class='plans'> , to increase my independence.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>Other things I can do to increase my independence include:



                            <li> I can keep change for phone calls on me at all times. I understand that if I use my telephone credit card, the following month the telephone bill will tell my batterer those numbers that I called after I left. To keep my telephone
                                communications confidential, I must either use coins or I might get a friend to permit me to use their telephone credit card for a limited time when I first leave. </li>

                            <li> I will check with <input class='plans'> and <input class='plans'> to see who would be able to let me stay with them or lend me some money in an emergency. </li>

                            <li> I can leave extra clothes with <input class='plans'> . </li>

                            <li> I will sit down and review my safety plan every <input class='plans'> in order to plan the safest way to leave the residence. <input class='plans'> (domestic violence advocate or friend) has agreed to help me review this plan.
                                </li>

                            <li> I will rehearse my escape plan and, as appropriate, practice it with my children.</li>
                            </ul>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        
        <div class='step' <p>Step 3: SAFETY AND DRUG OR ALCOHOL USE. Most people in this culture use alcohol. Many use mood-altering drugs. Much of this use is legal and some is not. The legal outcomes of using illegal drugs can be very hard on a battered woman, may hurt
            her relationship with her children and put her at a disadvantage in other legal actions with her battering partner. Therefore, women should carefully consider the potential cost of the use of illegal drugs. But beyond this, the use of any
            alcohol or other drug can reduce a woman's awareness and ability to act quickly to protect herself from her battering partner. Furthermore, the use of alcohol or other drugs by the batterer may give him/her an excuse to use violence. Therefore,
            in the context of drug or alcohol use, a woman needs to make specific safety plans. </p>

            <p>If drug or alcohol use has occurred in my relationship with the battering partner, I can enhance my safety by some or all of the following:
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> If I am going to use, I can do so in a safe place and with people who understand the risk of violence and are committed to my safety.</li>

                        <li> I can also <input class='plans'> . </li>

                        <li> If my partner is using, I can <input class='plans'> . </li>

                        <li> I might also <input class='plans'> . </li>

                        <li> To safeguard my children, I might <input class='plans'> </li>

                        and <input class='plans'> .

        </div>
        <br><br>
        <div class='step' <p>Items with asterisks on the following list are the most important to take. If there is time, the other items might be taken, or stored outside the home. These items might be placed in one location, so that if we have to leave in a hurry, I can
            grab them quickly.
            <br><br> When I leave, I should have:</p>
